<h3>Rush Hour Franchise</h3>
<p>A trio of extremely funny and exciting movies starring Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker. <br> Personally I think the choice of these actors is the perfect match for these movies.</p>
<h3>Despicable Me</h3>
<p>My favorite Animated Movie. I can watch it 1000 times consecutively and <br>honestly I don't think I'd get bored of it.</p>
<h3>Avengers EndGame</h3>
<p>No words needed to describe the greatness of this movie as it is known world wide. <br>Even though I did not experience it in the cinema when it released I still enjoyed it to the fullest.</p>
